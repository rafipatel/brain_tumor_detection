    "\n",
    "Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the brain. They can be graded as LGG (Lower-Grade Glioma) or GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) depending on the histological/imaging criteria. Clinical and molecular/mutation factors are also very crucial for the grading process. Molecular tests are expensive to help accurately diagnose glioma patients.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the most frequently mutated 20 genes and 3 clinical features are considered from TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM brain glioma projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction task is to determine whether a patient is LGG or GBM with a given clinical and molecular/mutation features. The main objective is to find the optimal subset of mutation genes and clinical features for the glioma grading process to improve performance and reduce costs.\n",

    "- **Project:**  This feature denotes the project or study from which the data is sourced. It can help differentiate data sources or cohorts, potentially capturing variations or biases from different studies. Understanding the source can aid in assessing the generalizability of findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case_ID:** Unique identifier for each patient\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender:** Indicates the gender of the patient. In some medical studies, certain types of tumors might show a slight prevalence in one gender over another, hence it might have some relevance in understanding tumor occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age_at_diagnosis:** This feature represents the age of the patient at the time of diagnosis. Age can be a crucial factor as different types of brain tumors might occur more frequently in particular age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary_Diagnosis**: Describes the primary diagnosis of the brain tumor. This could include specific types or categories of tumors, providing important information about the nature or classification of the tumor itself.\n",
    "These primary diagnosis values can provide valuable insights into the type of brain tumor. However, the exact relationship between these values and the type of brain tumor would require further research and clinical studies.\n",
    "    - *Glioblastoma*:  Astrocytomas are the most common type of glioma1. They can develop in most parts of the brain and sometimes in the spinal cord1. This type of tumor can be associated with both LGG and GBM, depending on the grade of the tumor1.,\n",
    "    - 'Astrocytoma, anaplastic' : Anaplastic astrocytoma is a grade 3 astrocytoma. While they’re rare, they can be very serious if left untreated. Anaplastic astrocytomas grow quickly and can spread to nearby brain tissue. This type of tumor is usually associated with GBM.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Mixed glioma* : The behavior of a mixed glioma appears to depend on the grade of the tumor1. In terms of detecting Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), it’s important to note that LGG tumors can dedifferentiate into anaplastic oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma and subsequent secondary GBM2. Therefore, a mixed glioma could potentially be associated with either LGG or GBM, depending on its composition and behavior.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Oligodendroglioma, NOS* :  Oligodendrogliomas are a type of brain tumor that develops from a type of glial cell called an oligodendrocyte1. They are characterized by IDH mutation and 1p19q codeletion and can be WHO CNS grade 2 or 31. This type of tumor is usually associated with LGG1. The term “NOS” stands for “Not Otherwise Specified”, which means that the testing for a mutation in IDH and 1p19q co-deletion cannot be performed or the testing is inconclusive, but the tumor has the microscopic features of an oligodendroglioma1\n",

    "    - *Oligodendroglioma, anaplastic* : In terms of detecting Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), it’s important to note that LGG tumors can dedifferentiate into anaplastic oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma and subsequent secondary GBM3. Therefore, anaplastic oligodendroglioma could potentially be associated with either LGG or GBM, depending on its composition and behavior.,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Astrocytoma, NOS* : Astrocytomas are a type of brain tumor that develops from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes1. They belong to a group of tumors called gliomas1. Astrocytomas are the most common type of glioma1. They can develop in most parts of the brain and sometimes in the spinal cord1. This type of tumor can be associated with both LGG and GBM, depending on the grade of the tumor1.,\n",

    "- **Race:** Indicates the race or ethnicity of the patient. However, in medical datasets, race is sometimes collected to understand disparities in healthcare outcomes rather than directly relating to tumor classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IDH1 and IDH2:** Mutations in these genes are commonly found in gliomas. IDH mutations are **especially prevalent in lower-grade gliomas (LGG)** and can help distinguish them from glioblastomas (GBM).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CIC:** .In the context of brain tumors, a study reported on the effects of the CIC mutation biomarker alongside radiomics features on the predictive ability of CIC **mutation status in lower-grade gliomas (LGG)**. Therefore, the presence of CIC mutations can be a significant factor in detecting LGG. However, the exact relationship between CIC mutations and the type of brain tumor would require further research and clinical studies1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MUC16:** It was found that LGG and GBM have low expression of MUC16, but it is **frequently mutated in GBM**. (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.10.22270821v2.full.pdf)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **NF1:** The NF1 gene, which encodes the neurofibromin protein, is a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway1. Mutations in the NF1 gene have been associated with various types of cancers, including gliomas23.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FUBP1:**  In the context of brain tumors, FUBP1 mutations have been detected in oligodendrogliomas but not in oligoastrocytomas.the presence of FUBP1 mutations can be a **significant factor in detecting Lower Grade Glioma (LGG)**. However, the exact relationship between FUBP1 mutations and the type of brain tumor would require further research and clinical studies21\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RB1:** . The presence of RB1 mutations could **potentially be a factor in detecting both LGG and GBM**, but the exact relationship would require further research and clinical studies1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTCH1:** On the other hand, NOTCH1 is deemed to be activated in primary glioblastoma, whereas low-grade astrocytomas, which are a type of Lower Grade Glioma (LGG), seem to show an inactive Notch signaling2. Therefore, the activity of **NOTCH1 could potentially also be a factor in detecting LGG**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BCOR:** The BCL6 corepressor gene (BCOR) is a tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome X that regulates cell differentiation and body structure development1.However, the specific role of BCOR in Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is not well-studied.

    "- **GRIN2A:** The GRIN2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called GluN2A, which is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord, including regions of the brain involved in speech and language1.However, the specific role of GRIN2A in Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is not well-studied.

    "- **FAT4:** The FAT4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in most tissues1. However, the specific role of FAT4 in Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) or Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is not well-studied.
